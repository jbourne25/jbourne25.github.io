As it was time to begin my project, I had decided on an LSU Tigers Roster App that would pull the team's roster and give information on each player.  I began by reading the information given in the CLI Data Gem Portfolio Project (lab) to familiarize myself with what was necessary to complete this first project.  Next, I watched a couple of videos on how to build a CLI.  These videos really helped me to understand where to begin as there was so much to do, as a whole, that I had no idea where to start. 
So I began with installing bundle to get things set up.  Once I had my files working with each other, I started on my CLI and Player file. I started writing code as to how I wanted my app to look, going back and forth between the two files trying to make them work.  I would say the hardest part of the project for me, or most time consuming, was finding the web page that I would be able to scrape.  I probably tried 6 or 7 different web pages before I found one that worked.  I would recommend really going through the web page, that you are wanting to scrape, thoroughly before putting the time in.  This will save you a lot of time, and make sure you are knowledgeable regarding what can and can't be scraped.  I had a difficult time cutting my losses and moving on to the next web page.  I kept thinking I could find a way to pull the information that I needed when either it wasn't possible or it wasn't within my skills to do so.  
This project taught me a great deal regarding how to research and find the answers I needed, but also how to ask for help.  No one, especially at my level, knows everything.  After spending some time researching, if you can't find the answer then ask someone.  I have realized that this field is truly a great environment of people helping people, and when you reach a level of knowledge and understanding that you in turn pay it forward as well.
